FUNCTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

set of predefined code
types:


single rows functions
	- operate on single rows
	- return only one result per row

multiple rows functions:
	- operate on multiple rows
	- return one result per group of rows
	- group functions or aggregate functions 

AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS

- COUNT()
- AVG()
- SUM()
- MIN()
- MAX()

--- GROUP BY & HAVING

GROUP BY:-

this clause is used to group rows based on one or more columns

HAVING:-

since aggregate functions cannot be used directly in the where clause 
WHERE works for filtering individual rows
so we use HAVING 
HAVING can filter in a group of rows


SUBQUERIES

WHY? 
if a query needs to work based on the o/p of another query
ie; the value feeding where the class is dynamic
what?
it is a query whose results are passed as the argument for another query 


types----------------------------

- single row subquery
- multiple row subquery
- multiple column subquery

Oracle Database imposes no limit on the number of subquery levels in the FROM clause of the top-level query. You can nest up to 255 levels of subqueries in the WHERE clause.

some of the most common places where the subqueries can be used 

- WHERE
- FROM
- HAVING 
- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE
- EXISTS
- JOIN
- IN
- SELECT

Using IN , ANY , ALL operators

>ALL --- more than max(AND logical operator)
<ALL --- less than the min
<ANY --- less than the max(OR logical operator)
>ANY --- more than the min

============================================================================================
CORRELATED SUBQUERY

In a normal subqueries , the inner query works first and the result is applied for each row of the outer query

 in correlated subquery, depends on the value of the outer query. It runs once for each query in the outer query

SACLAR SUBQUERY

that return a single column in the single row
cannot be used for 
- Default value for columns
- check constraints
