DATABASE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Database is an organised collection of interrelated data without harmful redundancy

DBMS - Database Management System

It is a software designed, retrieve, define and manage data in a Database

Characteristics of a good database:
 -- store any kind of data 
 -- good backup and recovery 
 -- multi user support
 -- provides multiple views for different users in one organisation
 -- DBMS follows the concept of normalization to minimize the redundancy of a relation
 -- Simple query language to insert, retrieve, update and delete data

DATA MODELS

 -- it is a collection of tools for describing data and their relationship

They are:
  -- Object Based Logical Models


	- ER Models
		- based on entities and their attributes
		- relationship among the entities
		- entity : real world thing (Person, student, bank account etc)
		- Mapping cardinalities - no. of association between entities
			- one to one 
			- one to many
			- many to many
			- many to one

	- Object Oriented Models


  -- Record Based Logical Models
	- Relational Models
	- Hierarchical Models
	- Network Models
  -- Physical Data Model

Relational models  - values to relate records(to relate 2 or more data) 
		     Concept of tables
hierarchical models - data represented as trees hierarchy
		      many to many relationship is not possible
		      pointers are used to represent data
Network Model - Data represented as graph
		many to many relationship is possible



RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)

1970 -- Dr EF Codd 
basis of RDBMS
eg : MS SQL, My-SQL, IBM, DB2, Oracle

RDBMS -- most commonly used 

Data is represented as tuples(rows)

primary key and foriegn key(PK and FK)
terms:
Relation : Table
attributes : Columns
domain : set of available values
	 the type and range of values
	 eg: stud_id => domain : integer values from 1-100
tuple : a row
cardinality : no. of rows
degree : no. of columns

Oracle  --- Not case sensitive
--------------------------
RDBMS
-also called OracleDB
-produced by Oracle Corporation
- in 1977 by Lawrence Ellison and team 

Database languages
-------------------------------
DDL (Data Definition Language) - define db structure

Create
Alter
Drop - Delete a table
Truncate - remove all records and keeping the structure
Rename


Data types

char - fixed length 1 - 200
varchar - variable length 1 - 4000
number(p,s)
	p = precision -- total no.of digits
	s = scale -- no.of digits to the right of the decimal point
date 
long upto 2 GB

Create a table 
------------------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE table_name 
(
	attribute datatype(size)
);
Alter
----------------------------------

1.Increase/decrease the length of a column
2.To change the datatype of a column
3.To add a column
4.TO drop an existing column
5.To change the column name

---------------------------------------
Constraints
---------------------------------------

-- used to specify rules for the data in the table 

- not null
- primary key
- foreign key
- unique
- references
- on delete cascade
- on delete set null
- check


DML -- Data Manipulation Language

- add data
- modify/change data 
- remove data

INSERT 
UPDATE -- updating the data
DELETE -- delete specific rows
