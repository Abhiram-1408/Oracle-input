constraints
- Not null
- Primary key
- Unique
- Foreign Key
- References
- ON delete cascade
- On delete set null
- Check

1. Unique

	- to restrict duplicate values into columns
	- to accept null values

2. NOT NULL

	- opposite of unique
	- restricts the entry of null but allows duplicate values 

3.CHECK 
	- To check values user defined condition on a column 
	- accepts duplicate but does not accept null
	- SYNTAX : col_name datatype size CHECK condition

4. PRIMARY KEY

	- Will not accept null
	- no duplicate values

5. FOREIGN KEY

	- Will not accept null
	- will accept duplicate values

6. ON DELETE CASCADE

	- when a row in  the parent table is deleted, all the related rows in  the child table are automatically deleted as well.

---- SELECT 

- show all data 
-  select needed data only(specific columns)
- Distinct

copy a table data into another table (second table should be having the same structure)


--- OPERATORS

--- ARITHEMATIC OPERATORS

+,-,*,/

--- COMPARISION/ RELATIONAL OPERATORS

=,<,>,<=,>=,<>,  BETWEEN...AND , IN, LIKE , IS NULL


==============================================================================================

---- JOINS 

used to select data from multiple tables
*  A join clause is used to combine rows from 2 or more tables , baes on a related column (common column ) between them
why? 
simple select can select only from a single table 


GENERAL SYNTAX:

SELECT FORM TABLE1.col, TABLE2.col
FROM table1 join table2
ON
(table1.commoncol = table2.commoncol)

-EQUI join
-NON EQUI join
- cross join
- outer join
	-left
	-right
	-full
-self join


-----SELF JOIN

- To check the internal consistency of a table data
